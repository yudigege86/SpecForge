# SGLang patch inventory and supported version

SpecForge pins `sglang==0.5.19` by default. A separately versioned patch supports
the Kimi K3 SGLang fork at the current validated `kimi-k3` branch tip `9acd9cb`
(and its original `f8493a4` integration point). There are deliberately separate
SGLang integration surfaces.

## Online: external spec-capture server

Online training uses one of these source-specific patches:

| Target | Patch | Capture methods |
|---|---|---|
| SGLang v0.5.19 | [`patches/sglang/v0.5.19/spec-capture.patch`](../../patches/sglang/v0.5.19/spec-capture.patch) | EAGLE3, DFlash, DFlash2, DSpark |
| SGLang v0.5.18 | [`patches/sglang/v0.5.18/spec-capture.patch`](../../patches/sglang/v0.5.18/spec-capture.patch) | EAGLE3, DFlash, DSpark |
| Kimi K3 SGLang `9acd9cb` (`f8493a4` compatible) | [`patches/sglang/kimi-k3-f8493a4/spec-capture.patch`](../../patches/sglang/kimi-k3-f8493a4/spec-capture.patch) | EAGLE3, DFlash, DSpark |

The patch adds `--enable-spec-capture` and a server-side sink that:

1. captures requested auxiliary and final hidden states during prefill;
2. writes tensors into Mooncake using `MooncakeFeatureStore`'s key layout
   from a background writer thread (one `batch_put_from` RPC per scheduler
   batch), off the scheduler's critical path; and
3. returns only key, shape, and dtype metadata in
   `meta_info["spec_capture"]`, and only after every feature object of the
   request has been durably published — a response therefore guarantees the
   refs it names are readable.

Capture transfers overlap the next target prefill instead of blocking it:
the aux/last-hidden D2H rides the overlap scheduler's `copy_to_cpu` copy
stream, per-request tensors stay zero-copy views into the batch-level host
buffer, and the scheduler retains at most
`SGLANG_SPEC_CAPTURE_MAX_PENDING_BATCHES` (default 2) in-flight batches
before it blocks on the oldest — bounding pinned-host memory while keeping
backpressure. The idle loop never enters the sleeper while a transfer is
outstanding, so a lone in-flight response cannot deadlock a waiting
producer. Set `SGLANG_SPEC_CAPTURE_TIMING=1` to log per-stage
materialize/register/put timings and queue-to-stream latency.

The client boundary is
[`adapters/server_capture.py`](adapters/server_capture.py). Algorithm-owned
providers map generic server artifacts (`aux`, `last_hidden`, passthrough
inputs) to training feature names. No trainer or producer process imports
SGLang model-runner internals or loads a target model.

The default patch is dry-run validated against the v0.5.19 tag. Capture requests
carry a unique `extra_key`, so every training sample executes a full prefill even
when radix cache support is present. Managed-local launch preserves the
historical disabled-cache default; hybrid targets that require the unified radix
tree set `model.sglang_disable_radix_cache: false`.

For targets that declare `logits_mup_width_multiplier`, the SGLang model passes
an LM-head-scaled hidden state into the logits processor. The capture patch
restores the pre-head-scale post-norm representation because SpecForge folds
the same multiplier into the frozen target head used during training.

Apply the default patch with `scripts/apply_sglang_spec_capture_patch.sh`, or
the K3 patch with
`scripts/apply_sglang_spec_capture_patch.sh --target kimi-k3-9acd9cb`.
On the default patch, `--spec-capture-method dspark` rides the DFlash aux
plumbing (`set_dflash_layers_to_capture`), which stock v0.5.19 models, including
Inkling, implement; DSpark and DFlash capture the same aux/last-hidden artifacts,
so managed-local DSpark launches work unchanged. The K3 patch instead routes
`--spec-capture-method dspark` to the model's dedicated
`set_dspark_layers_to_capture` hook. It also keeps 64K capture correct by using
64-bit Triton pointer arithmetic, scale-stable residual scoring, and a generic
Marlin reduction fallback when the token dimension exceeds CUDA grid.y's
65,535 limit. The server-capture unit and GPU gates must pass before updating
either supported source revision.

## Offline: dedicated local capture

[`../offline_capture`](../offline_capture) is used exclusively by
`scripts/prepare_hidden_states.py`. Its `sglang_backend` owns the local,
version-pinned APIs required for offline EAGLE3 preprocessing:

| Dependency | Upgrade risk |
|---|---|
| `CaptureHiddenMode.FULL` and logits-processor replacement | hidden-state output fields or pruning behavior may change |
| `set_eagle3_layers_to_capture` / `set_dflash_layers_to_capture` / `set_dspark_layers_to_capture` | strategy-specific layer-selection APIs may move |
| `ScheduleBatch`, `ForwardBatch`, and `ModelRunner` construction | constructor and memory-pool setup may change |
| splitting captured states by request input length | token packing conventions may change |
| DP-attention/model-parallel initialization patches | distributed group signatures may change |

This package computes no logits and supports text EAGLE3, DFlash, Domino, and
K3 DSpark state capture needed by the preprocessing script. It does not provide
HF/custom backends, VLM capture, online rollout, or a general target-engine
factory.

`tests/test_runtime/test_sglang_0518_compat.py` guards the patched 0.5.18 API
seams, and
`tests/test_offline_capture/test_sglang_backend.py`
provides the GPU smoke coverage for dense and MoE offline capture.
